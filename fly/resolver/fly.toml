# IMPORTANT:
# We intentionally do NOT define any [http_service] or [[services]] here.
# That keeps it from being publicly exposed via Fly's edge.
#
# The resolver still listens on 0.0.0.0:5053 inside the VM/container.
# The API will reach it over Fly private networking at:
#   dns-checking-resolver.internal:5053
#
# If you later want to add private health checks or private services, we can,
# but this is the simplest secure baseline.
